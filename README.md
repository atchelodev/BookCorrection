# My C++ Solutions

These are my solutions to the exercises in Y. Daniel Liang's Introduction to Programming with C++ (3rd Edition) International Edition. I will not include the exercise issue for the related code because I do not have authorization to do so. If you have any code suggestions, please submit a pull request. Please keep in mind that I am not permitted to complete the program with code syntax that I did not encounter in the book. As a result, I am unable to use loops in a solution prior to Chapter 5.

PLEASE NOTE I AM LEARNING THIS AS A HOBBY SO UPDATES ARE NOT REGULAR.
